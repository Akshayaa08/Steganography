# Steganography
Image Steganography using OpenCV is a Python-based project that allows users to hide and retrieve secret messages within images using pixel manipulation. The tool encodes a text message into an image and retrieves it later using a passcode. It ensures secure and hidden communication while maintaining the imageâ€™s appearance.
